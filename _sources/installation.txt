Installation
============

Due to the early state of this project, there is a good chance that parts of
these instructions are out of date at any given time. If you run into any such
issue please let us know on our `issue tracker`_.

Assumptions
-----------
For the sake of sanity, good deployment practices, and uniformity, we're
going to make some assumptions. It is perfectly fine if you'd like to deviate,
but it will be *much* more difficult for us to help you:

* You are deploying or developing media-nommer in a virtualenv_. We highly
  recommend that and virtualenvwrapper_.
* You are running a flavor of Linux, BSD, Mac OS, or something POSIX compatible.
  While Windows support is achievable, it's not something we currently have
  the resources to maintain (any takers?).
* You have Python_ 2.5 or later. Python_ 2.6 or 2.7 is preferred. Python_ 3.x is 
  not currently supported.
* You have an `Amazon AWS`_ account, and can create or destroy S3_ buckets.
